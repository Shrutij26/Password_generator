PyPassword Generator 🔐✨
📝 Description
This is a simple Python script that creates a random, strong password! 😎 You tell it how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want, and it mixes them up to make a secure password. 🛡️ It’s perfect for keeping your accounts safe! 💪

🅰️ Lets you choose the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

🔢 Uses uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.

🌀 Shuffles the password so it’s super random.

🖥️ Easy to use with a command-line interface.


🛠️ Tools Used

🐍 Python 3: The main programming language.

🎲 random module: Built-in Python module to pick random characters and shuffle them.

💻 Command Line: For user inputs and showing the password.

😓 Challenges Faced

🚫 Making sure users enter numbers (not letters) for inputs was tricky, as wrong inputs cause errors.

🔄 Randomizing the password properly was hard at first, but using random.shuffle() fixed it.

🐛 Had to avoid repeating random choices in the easy version, so switched to a list for the hard version.

📏 Keeping the code simple but flexible for different password lengths was a challenge.
